It's nice to meet you! I am a Web Developer who used to be a Construction Design Engineer.

If you were wondering, I was last seen working on [LACMA](https://buildinglacma.org/image_gallery), the section of the museum that spans over Wilshire Blvd. Yes, there are art galleries over a heavily active roadway.
